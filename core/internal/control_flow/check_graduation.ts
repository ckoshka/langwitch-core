			// todo: make this more declarative
			// this is an area where i notice mistakes in a lot, maybe 80% of them
			// and i find myself constantly tweaking different parameters and
			// changing the types of the inputs because i'm not 100% sure that
			// they're actually behaving as expected
			//
			// the annoying thing is, none of these transformations are reflected
			// in the type-system itself
			// the "have whether the queue is non-empty reflected as a generic"
			// was a good step, but we ended up erasing that information so as to
			// allow for sharing of the state with the IO frontend.
			//
			// and there are no 'hard' conditions under which the function will
			// fail completely, causing intermediate error-states that propagate
			// forward, causing unpredictable behaviours, violated expectations,
			// and invalid states.
			// the consequence is that it's essentially as if the function is mutating
			// the state.
			//
			// the only benefit of having it organised like this is
			// that it means several different states can be "simulated"
			// concurrently, i.e if the user is still typing an answer, we can go ahead
			// and anticipate 0, 30, 50, 70, 100 scores, then recalculate a new state
			// for each of them, so that there is absolutely no lag
			//
			// ideally we want to hide the ugly imperative execution away
			// leaving a modifiable configuration object
